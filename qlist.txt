2000 this text <j0sephandres> four hours and I still have this bug;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> ;(;
2000 this text <kinduff> what bug?;
2000 this text <jdeen> /exit;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> kinduff;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> kinduff ;);
2000 this text <j0sephandres> :(;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> kinduff;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> some help please, my app has an index view with create edit and delete actions, all it works, but when create an article and render the updated article list via ajax, the javascript who listen the event click on the delete link to reveal a comfirmation modal it's dissable simply does'nt executes, this javascript is in app/assets it works the first;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> time but when the content of the view changes does'nt works anymore, someone knows what may be happend it?;
2000 this text <kinduff> are you requiring ujs?;
2000 this text <kinduff> j0sephandres: please make a gist with your code;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> kinduff;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> kinduff yes;

2000 this text <Intii> Hi everyone, I'm trying to call the .all on an activerecord resource but I keep getting an invalid number of arguments error 1 for 0 error;
2000 this text <Intii> I read somewhere that in Rails 4, .all returns a relation instead of an array? I'm not sure what the equivalent of .all is now.;
2000 this text <kinduff> Intii: Do you want an array of objects?;
2000 this text <chipotle> so i'm learning how to use ruby on rails and ruby and programming in general and i have a question about environemtns. i'm using os x and homebrew. but the question is, should i create VMs of whatever stack i'm working with, or use vagrant? or should i just roll it on os x and accept the risks?;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> Intii: the returned relation works the same like a array, so just use it like one;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> chipotle: which risks?;
2000 this text <chipotle> bloatedness, for one. but what really concerns me is security;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> Why?;
2000 this text <andybernard> security on your local machine?;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> I mean you probably won't run the production service on your machine;
2000 this text <Intii> kinduff, Paiperkorb: The problem isn't getting an array or a relation, it's the error when I try to query using the .all method. For example Invoice.all(:created_at => datehere) and it says wrong number of arguments;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> Intii: that's wrong™. Invoice.where(..);
2000 this text <Papierkorb> Intii: or if you only want one, Invoice.find(..);
2000 this text <andybernard> Invoice.find_by(...);
2000 this text <kinduff> +1;
2000 this text <kinduff> 3 methods are valid;
2000 this text <Intii> Paiperkorb: All okay, I must have been reading old documentation then because I thought I could query in the all method;
2000 this text <Intii> Ahh*;
2000 this text <kinduff> Are you coming from 3.2 or lower?;
2000 this text <cnk> chipotle: The only "risk" I see ot developing on your Mac is that sometimes libraries are different between OsX and whatever flavor of Linux you deploy on. But the ease an convenience are so great, that I still develop directly on the Mac.;
2000 this text <chipotle> yeah, security on my local machine. like running mysql on my computer;
2000 this text <cnk> I would just suggest you set up a staging server earlyish;
2000 this text <cnk> chipotle: so bind it to localhost;
2000 this text <chipotle> cnk: where do you put the staging server? on your local computer? or aws?;
2000 this text <cnk> I think that might be what homebrews default is for mysql;
2000 this text <cnk> I would put the staging server wherever production is going to live;
2000 this text <cnk> Heroku, Digital Ocean, EC2 or ??;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> For learning? Really?;
2000 this text <frigidcode> cnk: Staging should ideally match production, so mirror production;
2000 this text <andybernard> staging should always mirror production as far as environment goes, otherwise whats the point?;
2000 this text <cnk> exactly my point;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> cnk: your stuff is running locally, most likely not accessible because you're in a NAT'ed network.;
2000 this text <frigidcode> cnk: Sorry, thought you were the OP on that question;
2000 this text <cnk> Papierkorb: I am not the one asking the question;
2000 this text <andybernard> sounds like NSA level stuff if you are worried about the security of a rails app on mac vs linux on a local machine for testing;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> cnk: I asked you if you're serious that someone *learning* RoR should already throw money at hosting solutions;
2000 this text <andybernard> To be fair, students with an .edu can get $100 credit to DigitalOcean;
2000 this text <cnk> About a month before they think they will put the app into production, yes;
2000 this text <frigidcode> Papierkorb: Heroku has free tiers to;
2000 this text <cnk> until then no;
2000 this text <chipotle> cnk: why would you want to learn on another server though? what happens when you aren't connected to the net?;
2000 this text <bricker> Heroku's free tiers are gradually becoming less and less useful;
2000 this text <chipotle> the nice thing about vagrant, from what i understand, is it is one click destroy;
2000 this text <chipotle> and one click launch;
2000 this text <chipotle> once you have an environment, you save the config;
2000 this text <bricker> they have a policy now that your app can only be running for 18h/day lol;
2000 this text <frigidcode> haha;
2000 this text <chipotle> engine yard looks nice;
2000 this text <andybernard> chipotle: yes it is, but it doesn't destroy data, only the environment in which it runs;
2000 this text <cnk> chipotle: Vagrant is great but it is not a complete match for production;
2000 this text <chipotle> i have a free year of DO thanks to github;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> Just start bin/rails server and focus on learning stuff, you will learn on the way the security implications.;
2000 this text <chipotle> and i hear AWS has a free tier?;
2000 this text <chipotle> but what i understand is google cloud is a much better deal and much cheaper;
2000 this text <andybernard> google cloud?;
2000 this text <andybernard> afaik they do not host rails apps;
2000 this text <chipotle> i am coming from a drupal background. but now i want to become a real coder and get a job in SF within a year. i hope that's realistic...;
2000 this text <chipotle> really?;
2000 this text <cnk> I tried out the free AWS and at least a few years ago, it was too small to run bundle install for a reasonable rails app;
2000 this text <chipotle> not their iaas product, don't they have a vps like product and you can put anything up?;
2000 this text <cnk> Last I checked Google was Java or Python;
2000 this text <chipotle> i see no point in heroku/engine yard really, i know how to build a server luckily;
2000 this text <chipotle> at least a LEMP stack;
2000 this text <cnk> OK so get coding on your mac;
2000 this text <andybernard> all in all I agree with PapierKorb. Talk of production/staging while learning is getting a bit too far ahead of yourself imo;
2000 this text <mloy> does anybody know why following <%= link_to 'hour', new_event_path, :remote => true %> gives me a 500 Internal Server Error here rather than rendering my _hour partial? https://gist.github.com/mmcnellis/3b819c90701c1bce4ab6/;
2000 this text <chipotle> is this the best way to learn rails? https://www.railstutorial.org/ i just finished chris pine's learn to program and now i'm going through the well grounded rubyist;
2000 this text <cnk> if you need to show something to someone short term, push it to Heroku's free tier. Then build a real server if and when you need the availability;
2000 this text <chipotle> but on my mac, don't i want to sandbox the development so it doesn't mess up anything else?;
2000 this text <chipotle> so that means make a VM or something?;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> or, if you have a VPS or root server already, just use that.;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> Why should it mess up "anything else"?;
2000 this text <cnk> chipotle: Rails isn't as much of a beast as Drupal so I wouldn't bother;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> chipotle: Do you think that ruby employs rm -rf / or what?;
2000 this text <andybernard> rails is a gem haha;
2000 this text <andybernard> and a ruby manager, well you should have one anyway;
2000 this text <chipotle> cnk: what do you mean?;
2000 this text <chipotle> Papierkorb: idk but i don't wanna be developing and then brick my laptop so i can't do anything;
2000 this text <chipotle> i rather jstu delete the VM if i foobar it;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> aha;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> If you manage to do that, congratulations, you must be the first one to do so;
2000 this text <cnk> chipotle: Rails tutorial is good. If you find it not to your liking, Rails 4 In Action is also pretty good;
2000 this text <chipotle> i bought the prerelease of rails 4 in action;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> You couldn't even yet present an attack vector chipotle.;
2000 this text <chipotle> actually, i think it has been released so i wonder why i haven't gotten the boo yet;
2000 this text <cnk> My favorite Rails book is actually Rebuilding Rails - but it doesn't really make sense as a first book - https://rebuilding-rails.com/;
2000 this text <chipotle> manning was really nice when for some reason my chase sapphire card kept declining the transaction due to fraud suspicion. i felt bad for the guy at manning, he had no idea why but said it has happened quite a few times with that card;
2000 this text <cnk> Another Ruby resource that goes well with the Well Grounded Rubyist is Sandi Metz's Practical Object Oriented Development with Ruby;
2000 this text <chipotle> is 1 year of studying ruby and ruby on rails realisitic for then finding a job?;
2000 this text <kinduff> chipotle: I started with 0 years of experience, now I have 4;
2000 this text <kinduff> chipotle: what im trying to say is that you'll be good if you know MVP and how to code, 1 year is enough but depends of the tier of the company;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> chipotle: everyone learns at a different pace, and every company expects different tiers of expertise.;
2000 this text <slash_quit> kinduff: minimum viable product?;
2000 this text <kinduff> slash_quit: sorry, MVC;
2000 this text <slash_quit> kinduff: i kind of figured, but didn't want chipotle to be scouring the web trying to figure out MVP;
2000 this text <chipotle> hehe;
2000 this text <chipotle> i know what MVP and MVC means :);
2000 this text <chipotle> i'm not a complete idiot;
2000 this text <chipotle> i actually have a startup idea. and i want to pursue it as CEO. but i want some tech experience. i reached out to sam altman and paul graham and spoke to them about it and surprisingly they responded. i hope taking the next year to learn more tech is okay and i don't get left behind as it is a hot field. but what i want to do exactly has not been done;
2000 this text <patrick99e99> hey guys.. just curious, is there a way to do where("? = 'foo'", 'col')  ?  When I do this, it wraps col in quotes..;
2000 this text <kinduff> chipotle: so what's the one million idea?;
2000 this text <patrick99e99> WHERE ('col' = 'foo')... and it should be WHERE(col = 'foo');
2000 this text <chipotle> who here said that google cloud doesn't support ruby? it doesn't seem like that is true? can somebody verify? this is what i got from googling... https://cloud.google.com/solutions/ruby/;
2000 this text <chipotle> kinduff: hopefully it's a billion+ idea;
2000 this text <chipotle> wealthfront is great but incomplete;
2000 this text <kinduff> chipotle: curing cancer?;
2000 this text <kinduff> jk;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> think bigger. how much money? All of it!;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> Because remember, the market growth is infinite /s;
2000 this text <cnk> chipotle: intersting. I didn't know about their cloud product. App engine I think was just python and java. Not sure now;
2000 this text <chipotle> when i was a phd student in boston, i ran a nonprofit that taught personal finance and the basics of investing to poor people. due to bureacracy i only really was able to teach prisoners at boston county jail (ironically, haha!). anyway, i've thought how i can expand that. i came up with it recently. wealthfront is good but incomplete. i want to be a total solution for personal and legal life of someone;
2000 this text <chipotle> kinduff: i wish! i have brain cancer so that would be nice!;
2000 this text <chipotle> so i'm off work and using the time to learn ruby when i'm not too sick;
2000 this text <chipotle> cnk: compute engine is like their infrastructure as a service product?;
2000 this text <cnk> Not sure. I haven't been keeping up;
2000 this text <Papierkorb> This channel is the one with the most ups and downs in a single day I know. Wow.;
2000 this text <cnk> Sounds like an interesting idea. Are you still in Boston? they have a great Ruby meetup group;
2000 this text <cnk> and the mailing list for the group is fairly good even if you are not local;
2000 this text <chipotle> no, i am in nyc;
2000 this text <chipotle> the type of cacner i have is very rare and the specialist is here;
2000 this text <kinduff> chipotle: sorry to hear that, bad joke from me, but you know, let's keep smiling :);
2000 this text <chipotle> don't feel bad;
2000 this text <cnk> Hope it is a slow one;
2000 this text <chipotle> they give me lots of opioids and ketamine so usually it's tolerable;
2000 this text <kinduff> chipotle: I'm at NYC right now, at News Corp for 5 days;
2000 this text <jher> chipotle: so kind of like Mint mixed with another site?;
2000 this text <chipotle> jher: not exactly;
2000 this text <chipotle> so like it's great to use wealthfront to buy index funds based on your risk profile. but wealthfront only does taxable accounts;
2000 this text <chipotle> there's still a lot more to investing, like IRAs. 401ks possibly. 529s for kids;
2000 this text <chipotle> not to mention, estate planning which is very important (trusts, wills, etc);
2000 this text <chipotle> all of this stuff can easily be done by software;
2000 this text <chipotle> a lawyer will charge you $3500 at the minimum to make a trust;
2000 this text <chipotle> i spent one semester at the law library while on my phd to learn to make a will and a trust and everything else. i had to. my gf was pregnant and i was poor.;
2000 this text <chipotle> most people don't have the ability or time for that;
2000 this text <chipotle> but it isn't complicated. lots of people in finance and law make things very complicated for their own reasons;
2000 this text <chipotle> but it really doesn't have to be;
2000 this text <nzst> Hi, how do I toggle the choices for the environment files when using the rails generator?;
2000 this text <nzst> the configuration options set by default aren't appropriate for my application, and they need to change across 3 environment files;
2000 this text <tubbo> nzst: uhh, you go into the source file and change them? :P;
2000 this text <chipotle> jher: i've already worked out the flowchart on how to do it. now i need to learn to program it;
2000 this text <jher> chipotle: would this be an application, or just a repo for information?;
2000 this text <tubbo> nzst: not sure what you're asking;
2000 this text <kinduff> nzst: had you tried Rails.env?;
2000 this text <chipotle> i just need to find a lawyer and a CFA that wanna quit their safe job in finance in nyc and do this;
2000 this text <chipotle> jher: an app!;
2000 this text <chipotle> it's clear that people don't wanna learn and they want someone else to do it. i realized this about a month ago. so it is clear to me this has to be an app;
2000 this text <nzst> tubbo: The Rails.application.configure for production.rb sets `  config.assets.compile = false` for example, I want that to generate as true;
2000 this text <nzst> kinduff: i'm not sure what you mean;
2000 this text <tubbo> chipotle: that's one of the biggest challenges to personal finance apps aimed at the consumer market..;
2000 this text <tubbo> nobody really wants to do it, so getting users to use it is hard;
2000 this text <tubbo> nzst: oh i see. yeah you can't do that within an app template afaik...you'll probably need to write the whole file out. it's probably just easier if you switched it manually each time you needed to do it;
2000 this text <tubbo> or added a gsub_file to your app generator...that might be a better approach;
2000 this text <chipotle> tubbo: yup, i know. but it's SOOOO much easier to sign up for an app than it is to go to one of my courses ;);
2000 this text <tubbo> yup;
2000 this text <nzst> tubbo: Do you know if these generated files change often, or typically just on major versions?;
2000 this text <nzst> tubbo: I might be heading the gsub route;
2000 this text <chipotle> besides, the reason why GS and the big wealth management firms aren't scared of wealthfront et al, according to friends of mine in the industry, is they don't target the UHNW individuals. so that's where i'm gonna start;
2000 this text <tubbo> nzst: it kinda depends on what they add :) but yeah, it usually changes on major versions;
2000 this text <chipotle> because most common folks don't think they need a trust, or even a will. i'd argue they are wrong. but i wanna start with scaring JPMorgan and GS private bank and go from there;
2000 this text <jher> What type of pricing model do you plan on?;
2000 this text <jher> And so you're basically thinking of an app that generates proper legal documents?;
2000 this text <nzst> tubbo: do you know if there is a file I can use that would take precedence of the configuration set in config/environments/ files?;
2000 this text <jher> nzst: 01_whatever_config.rb;
2000 this text <jher> we use similar files for loading environment variables;
2000 this text <dojobo> boo, i thought not_exist was an rspec matcher;
2000 this text <dojobo> looks like expect{}.to change is the way to go;
2000 this text <nzst> Does anyone know where rails new is in the source? im having a tough time locating it;
2000 this text <arup_r> how to add html class in this select https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/0b93fa639faf085d4063 ?;
2000 this text <ratmav> i'm trying to build a docker container image for a rails app;
2000 this text <ratmav> i've gotten the container to build up to the bundle install step;
2000 this text <ratmav> it blows up on the mysql gem;
2000 this text <ratmav> i know why: mysql isn't in the container;
2000 this text <cnk> but are the client libraries there?;
2000 this text <ratmav> but i thought it was docker best practice to keep the app in a container, the db in a container, etc.;
2000 this text <ratmav> cnk: elaborate;
2000 this text <ratmav> please;
2000 this text <cnk> to build the mysql gem you need mysql client libraries;
2000 this text <ratmav> on debian mysql-client?;
2000 this text <ratmav> that's all the gem needs?;
2000 this text <cnk> I think so;
2000 this text <ratmav> not the full out db;
2000 this text <ratmav> oh, wow ok;
2000 this text <ratmav> that's a time saver;
2000 this text <ratmav> lol;
2000 this text <cnk> no you can run the db and the client on separate boxes;
2000 this text <ratmav> i'll try that and see if i can rebuild the container;
2000 this text <cnk> have you looked into https://github.com/phusion/passenger-docker;
2000 this text <cnk> if I were doing Docker stuff, that is where I would start;
2000 this text <cnk> at least read their discussion eve nif you don't want ot use their stuff;
2000 this text <ratmav> will do;
2000 this text <ratmav> i've got some busted stuff that needs to ship;
2000 this text <ratmav> and they've got old opsworks cookbooks that nobody knows how to use;
2000 this text <ratmav> enter ansible and maybe docker;
2000 this text <ratmav> give me sec. i'll add the client lib dep and try rebuilding it;
2000 this text <cnk> ratmav: Look into this https://railsbox.io/;
2000 this text <cnk> I think it was a Rails Rumble project. My deploy worked immediately;
2000 this text <cnk> haven't used it in production but I was hightly encouraged;
2000 this text <cnk> my bet is getting ansible working will be faster than Docker - even if you eventually want to use Docker;
2000 this text <ratmav> yeah, i've done this with docker a few times;
2000 this text <ratmav> it would be faster to just go with that and a full vm;
2000 this text <cnk> So you have Docker things in production?;
2000 this text <ratmav> not yet;
2000 this text <ratmav> looking at it though, just to save resources;
2000 this text <ratmav> i'm going to be firing up several sites in the near future;
2000 this text <ratmav> so seeing where i can keep costs low (container v. full blown vm) is worth the time;
2000 this text <ratmav> but honestly i'm probably going to fall back to straight ansible and ec2;
2000 this text <tubbo> use heroku, it's free! :);
2000 this text <ratmav> lol not for closed source;
2000 this text <ratmav> i wish though;
2000 this text <tubbo> no, it's free for closed source projects;
2000 this text <ratmav> really;
2000 this text <tubbo> ratmav: you just have to pay when you want it to be not sluggish;
2000 this text <tubbo> because they tax you on performance;
2000 this text <ratmav> aHa;
2000 this text <tubbo> it's always slightly slower than their paid plans, or whatever;
2000 this text <ratmav> that's interesting;
2000 this text <ratmav> i'll bring it up with the team;
2000 this text <ratmav> for now i'm kind of stuck on aws;
2000 this text <tubbo> ansible is good enough too;
2000 this text <t4nkd> Hey rails, this hasn't happened to me before, what's going on when: I'm positive all the migrations have run in my production environment, but, `db:migrate:status` is showing that the only "migration IDs" that /have/ been run don't have a file on disc?;
2000 this text <arup_r> any pointer where I will see the test for this methods https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/c78c71bf6f2cd47d2923d1d530a772671ae4f161/actionview/lib/action_view/helpers/form_options_helper.rb#L162;
2000 this text <t4nkd> I definitely don't want to run-run migrations in production but it's totally out of sync with what rails thinks it should be... any way to get out of this situation gracefully?;
2000 this text <arup_r> not seeing here https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/c78c71bf6f2cd47d2923d1d530a772671ae4f161/actionview/test;
2000 this text <cnk> t4nkd: I would probably use SQL to make the migrations table match what you think it should. Is your db small enough that you can take a copy to practice on first?;
2000 this text <t4nkd> Err, that table is!;
2000 this text <t4nkd> I figured I'd be stuck doing something interesting like that tho;
2000 this text <cnk> unfortunately the main time consuming part will be verifying that the schema on production matches what you have when you run the migraitons;
2000 this text <cnk> rake db:schema:dump on prod and a clean dev instance will help;
2000 this text <atzorvas> anyone could help with devise & wordpress? I've followed the guide and I'm geeting "Not found. Authentication passthru.";
2000 this text <cnk> perhaps do the sql version of schema dump as it is slightly more informative re indexes, and defaults;
2000 this text <t4nkd> Yeah I'm quite confident that it's up to date, and I've got a staging environment where this is fine;
2000 this text <t4nkd> It's /just/ prod;
2000 this text <t4nkd> So in theory I can just steal my schema table from staging;
2000 this text <cnk> sounds promising;
2000 this text <cnk> backups. always take backups;
2000 this text <t4nkd> yeah, dually noted;
2000 this text <Radar> GOOD MORNING;
2000 this text <t4nkd> o/;
2000 this text <kinduff> Radar: Morning!;
2000 this text <hydrozen> I’m wondering, what’s the best way to test a file upload in a controller test? Like, how to I read the file to assign it to an attribute?;
2000 this text <hydrozen> Do I just File.read it or there’s a better object to use?;
2000 this text <hydrozen> ActionController::TestUploadedFile ?;
2000 this text <x-light> Good Morning Radar;
2000 this text <Radar> hydrozen: file_fixture_upload I think is the method;
2000 this text <hydrozen> yeah found it;
2000 this text <hydrozen> Radar: thanks;

2000 this text <bronson> I18n.transliterate('PÂTE') => "PA?TE";
2000 this text <bronson> Anyone know why that extra ? is in there?;
2000 this text <bronson> Seems to be U+00C2, which is handled by https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/blob/master/rails/transliteration/fr.yml;
2000 this text <bronson> Oh wow, ActiveSupport::Inflector.transliterate('PÂTE') gets it right.;
2000 this text <Silox|> I'm running my app in a subdirectory. Everything goes well for links and urls in my regular views, but when trying to link from a Datagrid (bogdan/datagrid), column, the subdirectory vanishes from the URL. Anyone encoutered this?;
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: transliterate doesn't use i18n. it's probably an ASCII vs. UTF8 issue;
2000 this text <bronson> you mean AS's transliterate doesn't use i18n's version?;
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: it might not. also, rails-i18n is not included into rails by default;
2000 this text <bronson> I18n.transliterate 'PÂTE'  => 'PA?TE';
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: you'd have to include that fr.yml file yourself to get all the nice transliterations;
2000 this text <tubbo> pretty sure;
2000 this text <bronson> which I'm finding really annoying.  Lots of people complaining about it, lots of workarounds that don't work anymore.;
2000 this text <bronson> really??  huh.;
2000 this text <bronson> owell, I'm going to use AS's version and pretend this giant waste of time didn't happen.  :);
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: until, of course, you deal with the next french language accent;
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: AS::Inflector might not do that. plus if i change inflections.rb in config/initializers i can break that;
2000 this text <bronson> Looks like AS does them all correctly.  verifying now.;
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: use the right tool for the job;
2000 this text <tubbo> yeah but Inflector isn't for transliterating or translating..;
2000 this text <bronson> tubbo: wat?  Then why does it have a method named 'transliterate' ?;
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: probably to provide a convenience. i'm not sure, never needed to use it. but the i18n gem and rails' integration of said gem is a better fit for this;
2000 this text <bronson> tubbo: sounds plausible...  but how do I get it to handle 'Â' correctly?;
2000 this text <bronson> I've tried two SO answers, both hopelessly out of date.;
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: i already told you that;
2000 this text <bronson> what, load the .fr file in an initializer?;
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: no, i'd say those transliterations should be in your locale file;
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: but you were saying you were having trouble with that?;
2000 this text <tubbo> or did you just try I18n.transliterate('PATE') without doing any locale file customizations?;
2000 this text <bronson> right, I haven't done any locale customizations.;
2000 this text <bronson> Seems to handle all other chars correctly.;
2000 this text <tubbo> yeah i mean, it says 'Replaces non-ASCII characters with an ASCII approximation, or if none exists, a replacement character which defaults to “?”.' in the doc;
2000 this text <tubbo> *shrug*;
2000 this text <tubbo> for AS::Inflectors.transliterate btw :D;
2000 this text <bronson> I know.  Here's the trick: it replaces it with the replacement character AND a '?';
2000 this text <bronson> supplying a replacement character of '' doesn't change anything.;
2000 this text <bronson> It's weird that those two methods seem to have identical signatures and functionality, yet behave slightly differently.;
2000 this text <tubbo> bronson: they come from two different codebases. https://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n;
2000 this text <bronson> they certainly do.  but it's still weird!;
2000 this text <bronson> maybe Rails 5 can clean it up.;
2000 this text <bronson> OK, I have spent FAR too much time on this.  I'm using AS::I.transliterate, which works 100%.;
2000 this text <bronson> I have no idea why I18n.transliterate isn't working and, hopefully, I never have to find out.;
2000 this text <bronson> WHAT A MESS.;
2000 this text <bronson> tubbo: thanks for the thoughts.;
2000 this text <andybernard> anyone here use subdomains with puma?;

2000 this text <bob14> Can someone help me with a query to get unique books downloaded this month? The query and issue is here: https://gist.github.com/theDazzler/ed338d243e2290df10b7;
2000 this text <bricker> bob14: Try `Download.where(date stuff).select(:book_id).distinct.count`;
2000 this text <bricker> bob14: Forgot the user part: `Download.where(date stuff).where(user_id: userid).select(:book_id).distinct.count`;
2000 this text <bob14> bricker: ok ill give it a try;
2000 this text <unholycrab> has anyone gotten Rubber to deploy to EC2 in a VPC?;
2000 this text <bob14> bricker: it doesnt work. if you just put `.select(:book_id)`, it will only return 1 even if multiple users downlaod the same book;
2000 this text <bricker> bob14: you're filtering by user ID right? So it'll only count the unique books that that user has downloaded this month;
2000 this text <bob14> bricker: no im not. Im trying to get the total number of unique downloads in the month;
2000 this text <bob14> bricker: form al lusers;
2000 this text <bob14> bricker: from all users*;
2000 this text <bricker> bob14: so remove the user condition;
2000 this text <bricker> bob14: just use the first example I gave;
2000 this text <bricker> that will give you unique book IDs in the month;
2000 this text <lagweezle> Using rails 4.2.3, mysql2, database.yml set to point to a socket /tmp/mysql.sock ...

2000 this text <a1fa> is there a try method for a variable?;
2000 this text <lagweezle> Best I can tell, the 'username:' value in database.yml isn't populating correctly through to the connector, but I've not got a clue why, or what I need to do, or if there is anything I CAN do...;
2000 this text <a1fa> i have something = something_that_may_not_exist || "default";
2000 this text <bricker> a1fa: what you have there is the best way to do what you're doing;
2000 this text <a1fa> its complaining about something_that_may_not_exist being undefined variable;
2000 this text <a1fa> -_-;
2000 this text <baweaver> something doesn't add up with that y'know;
2000 this text <baweaver> If it was just a single value that'd be a non issue;
2000 this text <bricker> lagweezle: it's "username", and you should gist your database.yml and the errors so we can look at it to help you debug;
2000 this text <bob14> bricker: using your first example, if another user downloads "Book 1" it will still return 1, instead of 2. That i sth eproblem;
2000 this text <bricker> a1fa: then define that variable;
2000 this text <baweaver> Now if you're trying to _call_ something on nil.... Well that's a different issue.;
2000 this text <a1fa> bricker: its part of active record;
2000 this text <baweaver> something_that_may_not_exist isn't just a variable;
2000 this text <a1fa> wait a mintue;
2000 this text <bricker> a1fa: oh? Where's the documentation for "something_that_may_not_exist"?;
2000 this text <baweaver> what's the actual code there?;

2000 this text <eristic> ellisTAA: did you run `rails g rspec:install`?;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> eristic: no;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> didn’t know i had to do that.;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> :(;
2000 this text <eristic> that'll generate a `spec` directory and a `spec_helper.rb` file;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> `require': cannot load such file -- test_helper (LoadError);
2000 this text <eristic> That too;
2000 this text <eristic> require 'spec_helper';
2000 this text <eristic> You're coming over from Minitest, right?;
2000 this text <lagweezle> EllisTAA: If you check https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails (the README.md, specifically) it has a walkthrough for the steps necessary to get rspec-rails installed and configured.;
2000 this text <eristic> ^;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> lagweezle: fo show thanks;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> eristic: i’m coming from no tests;
2000 this text <eristic> Ah, okay.;
2000 this text <lagweezle> EllisTAA: I had to do that not so long ago. There are ... a number of steps involved. None difficult, but definitely tedious.;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> so rails comes generates a test folder with a folders for MVC, but the spec folder has nothing in it, should i just recreate all the folders for my MVC?;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> thanks you two;
2000 this text <bronson> EllisTAA: no need to create the folders, but every time you touch something you should create the related file and some tests.;
2000 this text <eristic> You don't have to organize your spec files, but they do have to be named *_spec.rb for rspec to pick them up;
2000 this text <bronson> It's a huge grind to start TDDing on a zero-test project but it's worth it in the long run.;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> ;(;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> gotcha, this documentation looks pretty good;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> so should i just delete the test folder?;
2000 this text <bronson> I've done it a few times and the first week always feels hopeless... you're spending 90% of your time just trying to figure out how to fixture and mock stuff.;
2000 this text <eristic> shouldn;
2000 this text <eristic> t be a problem if you want to do that, EllisTAA;
2000 this text <baweaver> For everything you touch, make a test.;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> cool;
2000 this text <baweaver> trying to get all of them at once will double you over.;
2000 this text <bronson> Yep, stopping development to write all tests is a good way to kill the project.;
2000 this text <bronson> Talk about no fun.;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> ;( ;( ;(;

2000 this text <baweaver> to_sql it;
2000 this text <a1fa> is there a more efficient way than doing var.blank? ? othervar = var : othervar = "whatever";
2000 this text <lagweezle> a1fa: othervar = var.blank? ? var : "whatever";
2000 this text <lagweezle> a1fa: Is that what you meant, or something else?;
2000 this text <bronson> an alternative: othervar = whatever; othervar = var unless var.blank?;
2000 this text <baweaver> bob14 you're probably going to want an anonymous inner join which is going to be a pain;
2000 this text <bronson> neither is really great.;
2000 this text <a1fa> yes sorry;
2000 this text <lagweezle> No love for my rails + mysql username issue? >.<;
2000 this text <bronson> bob14: that's actually a pretty complex sql concept...  If you're determined to do it in a single query you'll probably want to use subselects.;
2000 this text <bob14> baweaver: what is an anonymous inner join? is there another way?;
2000 this text <bob14> bronson: i dont care if its a single query;
2000 this text <baweaver> I'd have to think about it for a while honestly;
2000 this text <bronson> well, you can just post-process what you have.  unique_dls_this_month = 0 if (user previously downloaded this book);
2000 this text <bronson> or unique_dls_this_month -= (books user dl'd before)  ...   however your code works.;

2000 this text <j0sephandres> lagweezle Excuse me, I do not understand what you say;
2000 this text <lagweezle> EllisTAA: Isn't session a local (method scoped) variable in that code, vs the instance scope (like @user)?;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> lagweezle: ur good;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> lagweezle new categories actions it is not the matter, it is any action wich changes content to the page via ajax, then;
2000 this text <lagweezle> j0sephandres: You have something listening for clicks to the delete button, which for adding a category doesn't matter. The AJAX updates, on completion, do they actually call something to notify your reveal-modal.js code to update the display at all? Can you confirm it is correct and actually being executed/called?;
2000 this text <lagweezle> EllisTAA: =D;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> lagweezle yes it's called;
2000 this text <lagweezle> How are is reveal-modal.js being called by the AJAX page update code?;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> i’m getting this error message: ‘ undefined method `lookup' for #<User:0x007fcfaae188a0>’ when i write @user.lookup, lookup is the name of a method in my model. can i not access the model methods this way?;

2000 this text <lagweezle> user = User.create;
2000 this text <lagweezle> user.lookup;
2000 this text <lagweezle> If that fails, at least we know it isn't rspec-land as the issue.;

2000 this text <j0sephandres> lagweezle sorry i think you haven't understand what the real problem it is, This issue revolves around but none of the thousands of solutions that I found on the internet has served me;
2000 this text <lagweezle> j0sephandres: The issues revolves around ... what?;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> lagweezle this is all about turbolinks;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> weird, it is not accesible from rails console either ...;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> ><;
2000 this text <lagweezle> j0sephandres: I thought you said you disabled turbolinks...;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> lagweezle i enable it to test the solutions I've read;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> i guess it was because i added self before the name of the method;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> I take all day about this, and I have asked several times in this chat and tell me it's always turbolinks;
2000 this text <lagweezle> j0sephandres: So if we know it is specifically a problem with turbolinks, sounds like you should go to https://github.com/rails/turbolinks and make sure you didn't miss something, check the open and closed bugs, and possibly file a new bug there.;
2000 this text <lagweezle> EllisTAA: Ooh. that'd make it a class method, rather than an instance method...;
2000 this text • lagweezle: heads off home!;
2000 this text <EllisTAA> lagweezle: bye!;
2000 this text <j0sephandres> lagweezle yes, or maybe php;

2000 this text <johnflux_> ah  (a)?b:c   works;
2000 this text <a1fa> is there a way in activerecord, to tell model, that it should always have specific field in table set to a value?;
2000 this text <a1fa> ie: damage_id is always 5;
2000 this text <bricker> you can set column defaults in your migration;
2000 this text <a1fa> so i dont have to do .where(damage_id :5);
2000 this text <a1fa> bricker: is that the only place?;
2000 this text <n00bdev> anyone here familiar with using devise?;
2000 this text <bricker> a1fa: er... you changed the question after I answered;
2000 this text <bricker> a1fa: you're looking for a default scope;
2000 this text <bricker> n00bdev: lots of people;
2000 this text <a1fa> yeah, default scope;
2000 this text <a1fa> i can google it now :);
2000 this text <a1fa> didnt know what you would call it;
2000 this text <a1fa> thanks;
2000 this text <n00bdev> bricker: the app currently im working on uses devise for registration, no problem. however, im working on a custom backend portal for admins and in that situation the admin will create the user. I was told to use devise_invitable to send the email for the user to create a password. I'm having a little trouble implementing it since devise_invitable is interferring with existing users who are trying to log in;
2000 this text <bricker> who wrote an article about the dangers of default_scope, was that you baweaver ?;
2000 this text <baweaver> ah, you're going to make me reauth;
2000 this text • baweaver: needs to ghost.;
2000 this text <baweaver> no, only about methods to deal with a ton of scopes;
2000 this text <n00bdev> does it make sense to use devise_invitable in that situation or just send a custom reset email template?;
2000 this text <bricker> hm;
2000 this text <bricker> baweaver: musta been another B-;
2000 this text <baweaver> but default scope is dangerous;
2000 this text <bricker> or pontiki maybe?;
2000 this text <bricker> anyways it was a good article;
2000 this text <bricker> oh wait;
2000 this text <bricker> !default_scope;
2000 this text <helpa> http://www.innovationontherun.com/activerecord-default_scope-is-an-anti-pattern/;
2000 this text <baweaver> Anything that can possibly be missed in a default search is dangerous;
2000 this text <bricker> maybe tubbo wrote it;
2000 this text <bricker> I think it was tubbo;
2000 this text <bricker> !defaultscope;
2000 this text <helpa> http://www.innovationontherun.com/activerecord-default_scope-is-an-anti-pattern/;
2000 this text <bricker> bleh;
2000 this text <baweaver> bricker: You know if AR has magical multiple self inner join features?;
2000 this text <baweaver> such that you'd: Post.joins(:tags).where(tags: {name: %w(ruby rails javascript)}) except it means it has _all_ of those tags;
2000 this text <baweaver> not just an inclusion;
2000 this text <bricker> no idea I stay away from that shizzzzz;
2000 this text <baweaver> The only way I know of is inner joining repeatedly on self;
2000 this text <baweaver> just trying to find a better way of that one.;
2000 this text <bricker> baweaver: you can probably concat the tags;
2000 this text <baweaver> It's common in SQL at least, just poking around for a nicer AR way to do it.;
2000 this text <baweaver> except they're a separate model entity.;
2000 this text <bricker> in pseudo SQL: `select concat(tags.name) as tag_names` ... seems reasonable;
2000 this text <baweaver> hm, fair;
2000 this text <baweaver> except in the actual case it's amazon instance tags which are key value pairs with other metadata that means it got a database table.;
2000 this text <bricker> yeah it's complex;
2000 this text <bricker> I use Elastic for complex queries like that (I fully realize this does you no good);
2000 this text <baweaver> so it'd be something like SELECT * FROM amazon_instances WHERE t1.key = environment AND t1.value = production AND t2.key = application AND t2.value = foobar;
2000 this text <baweaver> where you have the inner joins to generate t1 and t2 that I don't want to write.;
2000 this text <bricker> even if you get it that's gonna be a slow-ass query :D sorry I'll stop I'm being rude now;
2000 this text <baweaver> Ha, it's fine;
2000 this text <baweaver> It's kinda a confounded way to make it in the first place....;
2000 this text <baweaver> but you play with the cards you're dealt I suppose.;
2000 this text <bricker> indeed;
2000 this text <bricker> gotta jet good luck;
2000 this text <pontiki> i haven't written anything on default_scope. only thing i've got is a linkylink to justin weiss's article on preloading scopes;
2000 this text <n00bdev> is there a way for a controller to inheirit multiple controllers?;
2000 this text <n00bdev> im trying to do something like this;

2000 this text <helpa> Nom nom. Thanks, Radar!;
2000 this text <Ropeney> Radar you've been playing with elasticsearch alot, do you use cancan with it?;
2000 this text <Radar> Ropeney: I don't use CanCan with it at all.;
2000 this text <Radar> Ropeney: You can probably use a filter on ES to get a similar kind of feature though;
2000 this text <Radar> Depends on how complex your CanCan rules are;
2000 this text <Ropeney> yeah fair enough, was just looking at it and first thought was having to reload the objects from the db to get it to work;
2000 this text <hotpancakes> Quick question. When a signed cookie is saved by rails (cookies.signed[:foo] = bar), why is it necessary to read the cookie with the signed method?;
2000 this text <hotpancakes> e.g. cookies.signed[:foo] works, while cookies[:foo] doesn't seem to.;
2000 this text <jher> n00bdev, if you're inheriting from multiple controllers, then you're doing something wrong. Try DRYing it up into one controller and inheriting from that.;

2000 this text <quazimodo> guys;
2000 this text <quazimodo> capistrano's doing something uber weird;
2000 this text <sacarlson> so I can set a different bundler gem dir for each version as it seems they must share some gems;
2000 this text <sevenseacat> quazimodo: you've been warned about using 'guys';
2000 this text <sevenseacat> sacarlson: if you're needing to do that, you're doing something fishy;
2000 this text <quazimodo> sevenseacat: have I, what's wrong with guys?;
2000 this text <sevenseacat> !guys;
2000 this text <helpa> We're not all guys here - while you probably don't meant to be exclusive, not everybody feels that way. Maybe consider using "folks", "y'all" or "everyone" instead?;
2000 this text <sacarlson> when I google I see others with similar problems and they fix the same way as me with delete all gems;
2000 this text <quazimodo> wow that's some potent word replacementism;
2000 this text <quazimodo> folks;
2000 this text <sevenseacat> they're suggestions. do you have better ones we should add instead?;
2000 this text <quazimodo> don't have the thinnest skin on earth?;
2000 this text <sevenseacat> I guess that's a no;
2000 this text <sevenseacat> you just want to argue;
2000 this text <quazimodo> i've never been told saying 'guys' is offensive... it blows my mind;
2000 this text <sevenseacat> its not 'offensive'. its exclusionary.;
2000 this text <quazimodo> moving along;
2000 this text <sevenseacat> good idea.;
2000 this text <sacarlson> wow new problem with Restoring gems to pristine condition...;
2000 this text <sacarlson> Cached gem for json-1.5.5 not found, attempting to fetch...;
2000 this text <sacarlson> Fetching: json-1.5.5.gem (100%);

2000 this text <quazimodo> https://gist.github.com/siassaj/2c55962f62ada0f0ef4b;
2000 this text <quazimodo> so anyway;
2000 this text <quazimodo> capistrano is doing some super odd stuff;
2000 this text <quazimodo> my ssh forwarding works, verified and its all good;
2000 this text <quazimodo> i can ssh in, useforwarding to hit up github, and the deploy file configs are pretty much a mirror of another project running on a server configured the same way;
2000 this text <quazimodo> and yet;
2000 this text <sacarlson> I might be using this pristine wrong with rbenv I think;
2000 this text <quazimodo> it asks for password, and when suppled with the password it still doesn't work;
2000 this text <sevenseacat> sacarlson: #rbenv might be able to help you;
2000 this text <sacarlson> good idea sevenseacat;
2000 this text <quazimodo> doesn't even say who @xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx;
2000 this text <Radar> wait, people still use rbenv?;
2000 this text <sevenseacat> apparently;
2000 this text <Radar> There are people out there who have read my guide and NOT seen the One True Light?;
